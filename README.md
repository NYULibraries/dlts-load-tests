# DLTS Load Tests

Note that the JMeter test plans will work as-is if this repo has been cloned to `/tmp/dlts-load-tests`.
If you wish to place the repo somewhere else, change the ROOT user defined variable in *Test Plan Configuration*
from (using ACO as an example) `/tmp/dlts-load-tests/aco/jmeter-test-plan` to
`[Absolute path to root of dlts-load-tests repo]/aco/jmeter-test-plan`.

`${ROOT}` is used to specify the paths to the data files and reports output by the test run.
